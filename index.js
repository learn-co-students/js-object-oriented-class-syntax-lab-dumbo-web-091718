// build an ES2015 `Ceo` class with the following properties: `name`, `training`, and `homeState`.  Use inheritance to accomplish this.  A `Ceo` should have all of the methods that a `boardMember` has.
//
// Add a new method giving the `Ceo` the ability to hire new employees.  This functionality should not be available to a board member.  So the `Ceo` would have one new method:
// + `hireEmployee` â€” returns `Welcome aboard!`
